      Introduced ourselves, sat with our pre-assigned groups (group 4), and were introduced to the class. We participated in an ice-breaker activity where we told a story to the person sitting next to us. We were given little time to prepare, and the story was about some arbitrary thing that happened that day. After the first round of storytelling, we reflected as a class on what went well and what didn’t; essentially what makes a good story. We then got a short time to prepare and told the same story again, but this time in a more structured and interesting way. The class again reflected on how well the stories were conveyed and how interesting they were to listen to. We finished class with a brief discussion of what ethics are, both from the professor and with our groups. Note: There was a reading assignment, but it was just the acknowledgements, into, and table of contents.

        The reading assignment for the second class was the first chapter of the book, which dealt with the ethics gap in engineering education. This is referring to the difference between the prevalence of ethical problems in the engineering profession and the lack of training devoted to it in engineering collegiate education. The book cited statistics that the majority of engineering students expect to confront ethical problems in the workforce, combined with a majority of working engineers reporting that they had experienced ethical dilemmas in their careers. This coupled with the majority of students reporting a virtual absence of ethical training in the engineering program supports the authors claim of “a gap between education and experience” (McGinn, 2). The second part of the chapter had to do with the possible ways of bridging this gap, and the author argued that the prefered method would be to have a dedicated ethics course, as opposed to requiring engineering students to take a traditional ethics course or trying to integrate ethics into engineering classes. The advantages to a dedicated engineering ethics class are that it is more directly relevant to engineering students than a standard philosophy-based ethics course and that it would not have to compete for class time as the material would if it were integrated into an existing class.
        In lecture, we talked about what was covered in the first chapter of the book, and had a discussion within our groups as to our opinion. We then went on to look at three traditional ways of looking at ethics and their shortcomings of oversimplifying the inherent complexities of real-world problems. We also took time to individually come up with traits that we thought a “good” engineer should have, and compared ours with the class. We then took our first look at a case study: Cody Wilson and his publication of 3d-printable gun designs. The ethical problems of the mass-distribution of untraceable firearms are obvious, but there is still much moral ambiguity about the situation. We looked at the case using the traditional methods we learned, acknowledged their shortcomings, and then compared Wilson to our ideas of a “good” engineer. We finished class by looking at the ABET accreditation requirements for engineering majors and looked at how ethics fit in.

        We started with an exercise about failure (where the purpose was to fail), which was interesting. We were then assigned an item to do some brief research about, and ours was a phone (as in the original one). We were supposed to categorize the ethical impact in terms of the 4 FERE’s. This was difficult, as the initial telephone had little negative impact, and we could not think of any reasonable ethical concerns for the inventor. When expanded to modern phones though (cell phones), there is a wider range of ethical dilemmas, but this also poses a challenge because it is difficult to trace modern cell phones, and the infrastructure they rely on, back to the initial phone. We did conclude though that the invention of the phone did lead to a large paradigm shift in mass global instant communication, and it set the status quo of being able to talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time.

        We first grouped up with someone who had picked a different code of conduct, so I grouped up with a computer science major who had a code of conduct relating to the use of the internet. This was interesting because while I have thought about the internet as a private resource, I considered it a bit of a free-for-all, and I didn’t know there even was a universal code of conduct for internet usage though. One of the major similarities I saw between both of the codes we brought in, in addition with the lack of reference to ethics theory, was the ambiguity. I thought this was a bad thing, but one of the other classmates brought up the point that the looseness of the rules gives professionals autonomy to do what they need to do while sticking with the spirit of the code of ethics. I still find the codes of ethics to not be too helpful though, since they make broad statements like protecting the public to the utmost of the person’s ability. That isn’t too helpful though, since most people already seek to do this, and the real challenges are in the gray areas, such as derivatives of the trolley problem.

        We leaned a method of finding non-obvious harm, and applied this to the company Uber. Initially, I admit that I thought harm was an obvious thing, and that the impacts of some technology were evident through common sense. But, while doing the activity, I not only found stakeholders/actors I was not initially aware of, but my group mates and others in the class took entirely different angles to the problem. For example, I was looking at it mainly from the perspective of the ethics of interactions between the company and its drivers, but people brought up the issue of self-driving cars and where the R&D budget was being spent. I also never thought of how backwards it is that Uber does not invest in any physical infrastructure (for the most part), and yet they are making profit off the system. Now, that is not to say I don’t think Uber should get profit, or that I personally see anything wrong with their business model, I don’t, and the majority of the infrastructure is in software, but the drivers do have to make the purchase of the cars, pay for gas, and maintain them. Historically, the person who invested in the means of production made the profit, but here the drivers invest in a considerable amount of the means of production, yet do not profit off of their ownership status.

        Professor Tomblin gave a guest lecture relating the ideas of hopes and concerns about technology to autonomously driving vehicles. We began be thinking about our biggest hopes and concerns were about self-driving cars, and I quickly decided on being hopeful that autonomous cars would be more efficient in transporting people since they lack human error and self-interest, and I feared that people may not receive them well; the classic “the public don’t like technology because they don’t understand it” type argument. Prof. Tomblin explained that he led forums of average people to discuss autonomous vehicles, and challenged us to look deeper than simple explanation, such as the public being “afraid” of technology. Some of the points that participants in the forum made were entirely different than what I had initially thought of, such as the volunteer firefighter who was concerned about cutting the cars apart in the event of an accident, and the possible dangers posed to the rescue workers and the trapped victims. These concerns are not unfounded, since some electric driver-assist cars have batteries located behind the side body panels, and cutting into the batteries could pose a major risk for all involved. Overall, it shows that the non-expert public may not understand the exact technology behind an innovation, but they can provide keen insight into a variety of issues, which are necessary for engineers to identify and address.

        We talked about privacy and how it relates to data protection. Personally, I am rather opinionated about the issue in that I don’t care much for people’s complaints about privacy, specifically relating to national security. I believe much of the hype over it is caused by people being ignorant about how much data is being collected and resorting to complaining. It is true that the NSA collects a lot of data; it is also true that they are one of many groups that collects data and the one I would feel least concerned about. Other countries and people with mal intent are actively trying to steal people’s identities, whereas the NSA is a government agency protecting national security. There were other people in class who did have legitimate concerns about having fake criminal histories created about them, but as far as I know, this has never happened, and the only way they could dig up illegal activities would be if the person had actually participated in illegal activities.

       The majority of class was spent reading a brief article which had to do with the ambiguity of the word culture and how many views are inadequate. I was honestly surprised when we used these ideas to critique The Ethical Engineer, since we don’t usually question what is said in the book. I was glad we did this, since one of my major complaints so far has been how we seem to take what McGinn says as scripture, even when myself and others disagree with his argument; it was good to see that McGinn is not infallible. Our group,s article criticized anthropologists, arguably to ad hominem, for taking societal groups out of the picture when describing their culture, with the argument being that anthropologists can not claim to know more about a culture than those in the culture and that they cannot treat culture as a static thing. We were also asked to read the article while replacing “anthropologist” with “engineer” and to apply our analysis to engineers. Now, I see what the point of the exercise was, to show that engineers should take into account the dynamics of cultures and that engineers can be wrong. I would, though, like to add that, unlike anthropology, there are many aspects of engineering which are not subject to person beliefs or opinions, they are simply right or wrong. I am referring to one part in particular which read “...(they) rejected anthropologists and...”. In this context, I could see someone arguing with the results of an anthropologist, since the results are often qualitative in nature. On the other hand, this same excerpt read with “engineers” does not lead to the same conclusion. Whereas in the first example there is a chance that a cultural group could be more correct about their culture than an anthropologist, in the second case whomever is rejecting the findings of engineers is simply wrong; there is no room for argument. For example, if I calculate that monomethylhydrazine decomposes at 491K (Rocket Propulsion Elements, Sutton, Biblarz 2010) and someone argues with me that they think it decomposes at different temperatures in their society, they are wrong. This is a major factor separating engineering from liberal arts disciplines in that engineering deals with objective truths, ones that are true regardless of one’s belief in them, versus subjective truths, truths subject to individual opinion. Again, I understand the point of the exercise, but I just wanted to make the important distinction between opinions and fact.

        We started class with the provocative question of if engineers should vote. I initially took it as meaning if engineers should be allowed to vote, which I don’t see any reason why not. But I think the intended question was if engineers have a responsibility to vote. I know ideally I should vote (ideally everyone should vote), but to be an informed voter requires a decent amount of time with a high chance of no return. I mean, I don’t follow politics because I find it annoying, and I know a number of others who are engineers who don’t want to take the time to do the research all to cast 1 vote. Arguably, to have a large impact would require not only voting yourself but also convincing a number of others to vote with you. That, and there is the fact that there is no online voting. As far as responsibility goes, I would argue that adults who don’t want to can’t be made to, and that is a decision they are allowed to make. But, personally, I got talking to one of my group members who has more knowledge about local politics than I do who pointed out that local politicians have more of an impact on my daily life than I thought and that many only win by a slim margin since so few people go to vote. She also told me about a website where I can look up the platforms of all the candidates running in one place, which greatly simplifies the research process.

       We began by briefly reviewing sociotechnical systems and their application to challenger, which was useful because by now I had not forgotten but at least stopped thinking about the idea of sociotechnical systems. I do agree with Prof. Mogal’s sentiment that this is a complex issue which deserves much more time to discuss than one class period, but we have to work with what we got. I liked that we talked with our groups while Prof. Mogal showed different topics/facets of the case on the board. This allowed us to share opinions and both express and hear about different viewpoints while having a constant stream of new topics and information to discuss; honestly, it looked really well done. The challenger explosion itself is a very complicated event, and there have been many published reports and opinions. One point that I think is worth considering though is whether the Challenger explosion was a failure. I don’t mean to question if it was a tragedy, because I don’t think there is any debate over that, but thinking of NASA and the shuttle program as a design itself, everyone knew that there was a risk, and if they launched anywhere near as many shuttles as they planned, it would be statistically likely that some number of them would fail. For example, anytime a company manufactures a product, there is an acceptable percent of bad product, and it is impossible for this number to be zero at any reasonable scale. So, if a defective product is found, it is correct to say that the individual product is a failure, but this doesn’t necessarily mean the process used to produce it failed, since if the process being used to produce the product produces at or above its planned rate of success, it is operating within spec and there is nothing to fix. Similarly with the challenger mission, industry average of successful rocket launches is about 87%, I would say NASA performed admirably with a 98.5% success rate across 135 space shuttle launches. This is the basis for my opinion that the extent of the investigations after the Challenger explosion was unnecessary.
