      Introduced ourselves, sat with our pre-assigned groups (group 4), and were introduced to the class. We participated in an ice-breaker activity where we told a story to the person sitting next to us. We were given little time to prepare, and the story was about some arbitrary thing that happened that day. After the first round of storytelling, we reflected as a class on what went well and what didn’t; essentially what makes a good story. We then got a short time to prepare and told the same story again, but this time in a more structured and interesting way. The class again reflected on how well the stories were conveyed and how interesting they were to listen to. We finished class with a brief discussion of what ethics are, both from the professor and with our groups. Note: There was a reading assignment, but it was just the acknowledgements, into, and table of contents.

        The reading assignment for the second class was the first chapter of the book, which dealt with the ethics gap in engineering education. This is referring to the difference between the prevalence of ethical problems in the engineering profession and the lack of training devoted to it in engineering collegiate education. The book cited statistics that the majority of engineering students expect to confront ethical problems in the workforce, combined with a majority of working engineers reporting that they had experienced ethical dilemmas in their careers. This coupled with the majority of students reporting a virtual absence of ethical training in the engineering program supports the authors claim of “a gap between education and experience” (McGinn, 2). The second part of the chapter had to do with the possible ways of bridging this gap, and the author argued that the prefered method would be to have a dedicated ethics course, as opposed to requiring engineering students to take a traditional ethics course or trying to integrate ethics into engineering classes. The advantages to a dedicated engineering ethics class are that it is more directly relevant to engineering students than a standard philosophy-based ethics course and that it would not have to compete for class time as the material would if it were integrated into an existing class.
        In lecture, we talked about what was covered in the first chapter of the book, and had a discussion within our groups as to our opinion. We then went on to look at three traditional ways of looking at ethics and their shortcomings of oversimplifying the inherent complexities of real-world problems. We also took time to individually come up with traits that we thought a “good” engineer should have, and compared ours with the class. We then took our first look at a case study: Cody Wilson and his publication of 3d-printable gun designs. The ethical problems of the mass-distribution of untraceable firearms are obvious, but there is still much moral ambiguity about the situation. We looked at the case using the traditional methods we learned, acknowledged their shortcomings, and then compared Wilson to our ideas of a “good” engineer. We finished class by looking at the ABET accreditation requirements for engineering majors and looked at how ethics fit in.

        We started with an exercise about failure (where the purpose was to fail), which was interesting. We were then assigned an item to do some brief research about, and ours was a phone (as in the original one). We were supposed to categorize the ethical impact in terms of the 4 FERE’s. This was difficult, as the initial telephone had little negative impact, and we could not think of any reasonable ethical concerns for the inventor. When expanded to modern phones though (cell phones), there is a wider range of ethical dilemmas, but this also poses a challenge because it is difficult to trace modern cell phones, and the infrastructure they rely on, back to the initial phone. We did conclude though that the invention of the phone did lead to a large paradigm shift in mass global instant communication, and it set the status quo of being able to talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time.

        We first grouped up with someone who had picked a different code of conduct, so I grouped up with a computer science major who had a code of conduct relating to the use of the internet. This was interesting because while I have thought about the internet as a private resource, I considered it a bit of a free-for-all, and I didn’t know there even was a universal code of conduct for internet usage though. One of the major similarities I saw between both of the codes we brought in, in addition with the lack of reference to ethics theory, was the ambiguity. I thought this was a bad thing, but one of the other classmates brought up the point that the looseness of the rules gives professionals autonomy to do what they need to do while sticking with the spirit of the code of ethics. I still find the codes of ethics to not be too helpful though, since they make broad statements like protecting the public to the utmost of the person’s ability. That isn’t too helpful though, since most people already seek to do this, and the real challenges are in the gray areas, such as derivatives of the trolley problem.

        We leaned a method of finding non-obvious harm, and applied this to the company Uber. Initially, I admit that I thought harm was an obvious thing, and that the impacts of some technology were evident through common sense. But, while doing the activity, I not only found stakeholders/actors I was not initially aware of, but my group mates and others in the class took entirely different angles to the problem. For example, I was looking at it mainly from the perspective of the ethics of interactions between the company and its drivers, but people brought up the issue of self-driving cars and where the R&D budget was being spent. I also never thought of how backwards it is that Uber does not invest in any physical infrastructure (for the most part), and yet they are making profit off the system. Now, that is not to say I don’t think Uber should get profit, or that I personally see anything wrong with their business model, I don’t, and the majority of the infrastructure is in software, but the drivers do have to make the purchase of the cars, pay for gas, and maintain them. Historically, the person who invested in the means of production made the profit, but here the drivers invest in a considerable amount of the means of production, yet do not profit off of their ownership status.

        Professor Tomblin gave a guest lecture relating the ideas of hopes and concerns about technology to autonomously driving vehicles. We began be thinking about our biggest hopes and concerns were about self-driving cars, and I quickly decided on being hopeful that autonomous cars would be more efficient in transporting people since they lack human error and self-interest, and I feared that people may not receive them well; the classic “the public don’t like technology because they don’t understand it” type argument. Prof. Tomblin explained that he led forums of average people to discuss autonomous vehicles, and challenged us to look deeper than simple explanation, such as the public being “afraid” of technology. Some of the points that participants in the forum made were entirely different than what I had initially thought of, such as the volunteer firefighter who was concerned about cutting the cars apart in the event of an accident, and the possible dangers posed to the rescue workers and the trapped victims. These concerns are not unfounded, since some electric driver-assist cars have batteries located behind the side body panels, and cutting into the batteries could pose a major risk for all involved. Overall, it shows that the non-expert public may not understand the exact technology behind an innovation, but they can provide keen insight into a variety of issues, which are necessary for engineers to identify and address.

        We talked about privacy and how it relates to data protection. Personally, I am rather opinionated about the issue in that I don’t care much for people’s complaints about privacy, specifically relating to national security. I believe much of the hype over it is caused by people being ignorant about how much data is being collected and resorting to complaining. It is true that the NSA collects a lot of data; it is also true that they are one of many groups that collects data and the one I would feel least concerned about. Other countries and people with mal intent are actively trying to steal people’s identities, whereas the NSA is a government agency protecting national security. There were other people in class who did have legitimate concerns about having fake criminal histories created about them, but as far as I know, this has never happened, and the only way they could dig up illegal activities would be if the person had actually participated in illegal activities.

       The majority of class was spent reading a brief article which had to do with the ambiguity of the word culture and how many views are inadequate. I was honestly surprised when we used these ideas to critique The Ethical Engineer, since we don’t usually question what is said in the book. I was glad we did this, since one of my major complaints so far has been how we seem to take what McGinn says as scripture, even when myself and others disagree with his argument; it was good to see that McGinn is not infallible. Our group,s article criticized anthropologists, arguably to ad hominem, for taking societal groups out of the picture when describing their culture, with the argument being that anthropologists can not claim to know more about a culture than those in the culture and that they cannot treat culture as a static thing. We were also asked to read the article while replacing “anthropologist” with “engineer” and to apply our analysis to engineers. Now, I see what the point of the exercise was, to show that engineers should take into account the dynamics of cultures and that engineers can be wrong. I would, though, like to add that, unlike anthropology, there are many aspects of engineering which are not subject to person beliefs or opinions, they are simply right or wrong. I am referring to one part in particular which read “...(they) rejected anthropologists and...”. In this context, I could see someone arguing with the results of an anthropologist, since the results are often qualitative in nature. On the other hand, this same excerpt read with “engineers” does not lead to the same conclusion. Whereas in the first example there is a chance that a cultural group could be more correct about their culture than an anthropologist, in the second case whomever is rejecting the findings of engineers is simply wrong; there is no room for argument. For example, if I calculate that monomethylhydrazine decomposes at 491K (Rocket Propulsion Elements, Sutton, Biblarz 2010) and someone argues with me that they think it decomposes at different temperatures in their society, they are wrong. This is a major factor separating engineering from liberal arts disciplines in that engineering deals with objective truths, ones that are true regardless of one’s belief in them, versus subjective truths, truths subject to individual opinion. Again, I understand the point of the exercise, but I just wanted to make the important distinction between opinions and fact.

        We started class with the provocative question of if engineers should vote. I initially took it as meaning if engineers should be allowed to vote, which I don’t see any reason why not. But I think the intended question was if engineers have a responsibility to vote. I know ideally I should vote (ideally everyone should vote), but to be an informed voter requires a decent amount of time with a high chance of no return. I mean, I don’t follow politics because I find it annoying, and I know a number of others who are engineers who don’t want to take the time to do the research all to cast 1 vote. Arguably, to have a large impact would require not only voting yourself but also convincing a number of others to vote with you. That, and there is the fact that there is no online voting. As far as responsibility goes, I would argue that adults who don’t want to can’t be made to, and that is a decision they are allowed to make. But, personally, I got talking to one of my group members who has more knowledge about local politics than I do who pointed out that local politicians have more of an impact on my daily life than I thought and that many only win by a slim margin since so few people go to vote. She also told me about a website where I can look up the platforms of all the candidates running in one place, which greatly simplifies the research process.

      Class was centered around the Ford Pinto case, which involved Ford knowingly shipping cars with the potential of leaking gas in an accident of as little as 20mph. Our general analysis of the case concluded that Ford had taken actions incompatible with the FEREs. On the contrary, though, I would argue that Ford’s design of the car was fair, but rather their miscalculation was in public relations. The decision to place the fuel tank where they did is one of many safety trade offs made when designing the car, and it did not make the Pinto particularly more dangerous than its competitors. It is estimated that between 27 - 180 people died in the Pinto as a result of fires, and with this the total deaths in the Ford Pinto are not noticeably different from its competitors. The argument could be made that had Ford taken further measures those 27 - 180 people would not have died, but this is not necessarily true, and a common though-process mistake. For example, say a car suffers a sheared bolt on one of its suspension push rods, causing one side of the car to fall onto the ground and slide. Obviously, this is an engineering failure. An inexperienced engineer would say that they should simply use a much thicker bolt. The problem with this is that the bolt will not fail, but something else will fail first, likely causing a more expensive damage than a sheared bolt. This is why it is important to design a system for what will fail first. By the way, this exact event did happen at Terps Racing and I was one of the inexperienced engineers who were quickly corrected by a veteran. In Ford’s case, I’m not sure if the gas tank would be my choice for what should fail first, but at the same time if a stationary Pinto was rear-ended at 70mph and the gas tank caught fire, it is not sound to argue that a stronger gas tank would have saved the driver; better the gas tank fail than the cabin.

      In class, we analysed the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear reactor plant, which culminated in the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere, which caused the surrounding area to be uninhabitable. Personally, I found the discussion really interesting because I had heard of Fukushima, but I assumed it was either a simple engineering failure or a fluke incident. I didn’t realize that there were people who had analyzed the plant and found that it would be at risk of a Tsunami-earthquake combination, but had been overruled for political and economic reasons. The Cassandra-effect analysis also helped frame the event as one of many similar events instead of a completely unique case. At the time the disaster happened, I remember thinking that it must have been possible to engineer the plant to withstand a tsunami, but I thought doing so would have been overcautious and too costly. I’m betting this is what the people making the decision about the plant’s safety were thinking as well, and taken as a single case Fukushima could be considered a fluke. But, when looked at as one of many Cassandra cases, it becomes easier to argue that higher levels of safety should become the norm across the board.

      “Our Daily Bread”
We spent the first bit of class finishing up our talk of the Fukushima case, and then moved on to spend a good bit of class watching a silent documentary about the modern food production process. Honestly, when I think if that film, I just keep thinking of the scene with the chicks being conveyor belted around, and then being shot out of that chicken dispenser. In all seriousness though, it does give a rather accurate depiction of the production process of food and in a rather interesting manner; through a silent film. The lack of narration does force the viewer to focus on what they are watching, and I actually went back and watched some more of the film, and it does do a good job at drawing attention to some of the more disturbing aspects of the modern food production process. I generally am of the argument that factory farming is not the best, but it helps increase the planet’s carrying capacity of humans, so I would argue that it is a justified cost. The flaw in this argument, though, is that the production of animals for slaughter is an extremely inefficient way to produce large quantities of food, so we would likely benefit from a decrease in the quantity of animal consumption and eating more plant produce.

      I think the purpose of class was to make us uncomfortable. We began with Prof. Mogul’s request that we list off social taboos. I think she must have realized that it is generally socially frowned upon to talk about taboos, so asking us to list them off puts students in a difficult spot where they try to find the most socially acceptable way to respond, which generally means no response. After this, we were made to stand at the walls and asked what we would do if the doors were locked and we had to go to the bathroom. Again, most people didn’t move, since doing anything but standing still would make one stand out. I would argue that this is a genre of topic where the professor’s authority is questionable. Students come to class to learn the material, and to that end do what the professor asks. That being said, there is a limit and I would argue that if students are asked to do things that could threaten their dignity or would go against their morals, that student has a moral right to refuse to participate or leave the class. Personally, I am willing to do quite a bit to get a degree, but sacrificing my dignity or acquiesce to things that would diminish my self respect are not among those. I don’t mean to say this activity in particular crossed the line, but those are my general thoughts.

      We finished up one of the last case studies, one of which involved the the Topf & Sons case and the other involved the US ballistic missile defense system. In particular, the Topf & Sons case made a number of good points because it was, in many ways, far more extreme than the other situations. For the most part, it is safe to assume that the engineers involved knew full well the usage of their technology, especially since one of them stated so in a testimony and another went as far as to design and patent a new crematorium “purely as a facility for extermination”. The engineers made the argument that they simply built “innocent ovens”, and that their ovens did not kill anyone. However, McGinn makes a sound argument for why the presence of the ovens allowed the Nazi SS to increase their throughput, and thus they did lead to more deaths. The engineers also made the argument that their contributions were no different than designing an airplane, which also leads to civilian casualties. McGinn brushes this argument off because most warplanes are not designed to kill civilians, but I some are. This argument is more concerning for me because I am considering working for the DoD after graduation, likely working on projects referred to by the euphemism “defense”. While many of the technologies developed are for defence, quite a few are strictly offensive, and the question is raised if it is ethical for engineers to develop weapons at all. Many people would say this is going too far, but the rules of ethics must be universal, and the Topf & Sons case demonstrates that just because one’s work is for the government does not make it ethically sound. On the other hand, if this country, or any country for that matter, stopped producing weapons many civilian lives within its own borders would be at risk, and that country likely would not be around for long. So, the argument centers around how far is too far. For example, one could argue that the Topf & Sons case would not have been an issue to begin with if Poland, France, etc. had developed better weapons because they would have been able to defend their borders and stopped the Nazi advance. Another example would be the U.S. development of the nuclear bomb. Many in the U.S. justify its development as a deterrent to war and its usage as saving U.S. lives, but the use of that technology led to the deaths of between 129,000 and 226,000 people. Based on that, the argument could be made the the engineers involved in creating the atomic bomb are partly responsible for those deaths. Furthermore, an estimated 241,000 to 900,000 people, many civilian, were killed by “standard” methods of bombing in Japan, so the argument could also be made that the Topf & Sons engineer was correct in that designing crematoriums and warplanes are both unethical. Also, we have already differentiated between civilians and warfighters, and by that argument it would have been more ethical to have increased the loss of U.S. servicemen as far as necessary rather than use various technologies to kill civilians. In summary, I don’t know where the lines of blame should be drawn, as the ethics of war are complicated to say the least. I would argue, though, that this fact does not excuse engineers from acting ethically.

      A large part of class was spent working on our skits, which was quite helpful. My group worked on deciding who would be our stakeholders and which of us would research which stakeholder. This was a useful first step in our process of developing our skit. We also decided on some high-level details, such as the ethical conflicts, the lesson we wanted to communicate, relevant FEREs, and questions we had.

      We worked further on our skit, as well as meeting after class to continue working. We decided on what ethical issues we wanted to focus on, and started brainstorming how we were going to make a skit around it. We decided on having our skit center around a scene where our stakeholders were making their cases at a congressional hearing. This way, we could have our stakeholders state their positions and discuss their viewpoints. We tried to come up with something more original than this, but this was the only situation we could think of where it would be logical for our stakeholders to be discussing their viewpoints. We considered having them talk about it at a restaurant, but that didn’t seem plausible. We were also concerned with planning the background for our skit, and avoiding a rehash of the challenger case.

        A professional actor, and I’m assuming teacher, came into class to discuss ways to make our skits better. I thought that some of the things he had us do were strange, but I liked that he came in to give advice. I am generally interested in the art of acting, and I found some of the things he was talking about like objective and obstacle interesting. I had never thought about it before, but just about every scene of a play has characters entering with objectives and overcoming some obstacle to achieve them. It helped in thinking out scenes for our skit as well as (hopefully) improving the quality of acting. It is nice that Prof. Mogul put in the effort to have someone come in to help us with our skits, and it shows that she is rather invested in our project. It was also around this time that my group realized that we did not yet have a storyboard, and made a plan for meeting up to make one.

        Class was short because Prof. Mogul gave us the last part of class to do our class evaluations, which we made sure to do. It was nice that Prof. was open about how the evaluations worked and that she read them. I have had other teachers tell us to do the evaluations, but I have not had other teachers go in-depth about what the evaluations are and why we should fill them out. Our group also spent the end of class refining our setting, deciding on having our skit set after a commercial space company loses a satellite, causing the destruction of several other satellites. We decided to have the satellite be unmanned to avoid a challenger case rehash, but decided that some disaster scenario would set up the debate to be more relevant, instead of arguing over hypotheticals. Ironically, most of our skit was hypothetical, but since commercial space is developing we thought setting the skit in the future would allow us to explore the full breadth of ethical issues associated, and McGinn set the precedent of using hypothetical cases.
