    I am a freshman Aerospace Engineering student who is passionate about \
    engineering for a better society. I like engineering because I enjoy \
    creating things, but I am driven to pursue it by the idea of \
    engineering solutions that will enhance the capabilities of \
    humanity. Going into college, I was not naivete about the existence \
    of moral conflict in the profession of engineering, which was largely \
    due to the number of long conversations and debates I have had with \
    various people working in engineering or with engineers. Even before \
    signing up for classes, I had the idea that there could be a lack \
    of ethics education in the engineering discipline, so when I saw \
    this course offered (and that it counted for GenEds), I signed up. \
    I hope to learn about the different approaches to ethical dilemmas, \
    and most of all I hope to gain experience navigating complex \
    ethical problems.\

    The largest takeaway so far has been hearing the unique opinions of others. \
    The default reaction when I hear about some scenario is to form an opinion and \
    then try to gauge who is for or against my ideas and what support they have. Firstly, \
    this is problematic because it is overly self-centered in judging people as being for \
    or against me and then trying to prove them right or wrong, respectively. Secondly, \
    this mindset doesn’t work because there are more than two takes on any given issue, \
    and this is why hearing the reactions of others has been so helpful. For example, I \
    studied an article on the use of AI, with human guidance, to mitigate the spread of \
    “fake news” on social media. I analyzed it from the perspective of free speech and \
    the ethics of censorship, but a classmate looked at it from the viewpoint of the \
    ethics of developing AI in social media, which I had not thought about. In this way, \
    there are not two groups, with me and against me, but rather a nearly infinite number \
     of viewpoints that are different but not necessarily competing. It is important to \
     take these views into account when designing something, or else it may harm instead \
      of help. \

    "content": " \
    Since I do not use social media on any regular basis, my primary filter bubbles would \
    be the newsfeed on my phone from Google and the common-minded group of people I generally \
    associate with. I would consider the news feed a filter bubble of sorts because Google \
    customizes the news to meet my interests, as I ask it to do. Similarly, hanging around \
    with people of similar mindsets tends to create a circle of confirmation, which is not \
    always the best for finding the truth, since the scientific method would require attempting \
    to prove our ideas wrong, and thus supporting our ideas by an inability to disprove them. \
    In order to “break out” of my filter buble per say, I spent some time reading articles that \
    are less aligned with what I support, such as articles that show Elon Musk in a less than \
    perfect light and blogs that support Intel over AMD. In general, I can’t say my views were \
    changed, since I already knew the argument for Intel, and my inability to find new information \
    that would sway me toward Intel only confirmed my current belief that AMD is good price to \
    performance. Again, in the case of anti-Elon articles, I could not find compelling enough \
    evidence to reverse my opinion. Although, one example of something that I did change my \
    mind on was how I ride my bike on campus. Like many of my friends, I ride my bike to get \
    around campus, and also like many of my friends, I was of the opinion that the signs put \
    up by DOTS telling bikers to ride on the sidewalk and stop at stop signs were silly at \
    best. Since everyone I usually talked to agreed, I had no motivation to do anything \
    different. But, I decided to read a few forum threads by drivers who were complaining \
    about bikers to learn about the other side of the argument, and I realized that the \
    argument for bikers following standard road rules is sound. This led me to check \
    Maryland transportation law, and I found that bikes are in fact required to follow all \
    road signs and are prohibited from riding on sidewalks unless local laws specifically \
    allow it (and Prince George’s County doesn’t). This is an example of breaking out of \
    my bubble causing me to realize that my argument was not as sound as I thought it was, \
    which led to me changing the way I ride my bike to class.\
