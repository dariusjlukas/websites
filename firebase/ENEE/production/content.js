    I am a freshman Computer Engineering student who is passionate about \
    engineering for a better society. I like engineering because I enjoy \
    creating things, but I am driven to pursue it by the idea of \
    engineering solutions that will enhance the capabilities of \
    humanity. Going into college, I was not naivete about the existence \
    of moral conflict in the profession of engineering, which was largely \
    due to the number of long conversations and debates I have had with \
    various people working in engineering or with engineers. Even before \
    signing up for classes, I had the idea that there could be a lack \
    of ethics education in the engineering discipline, so when I saw \
    this course offered (and that it counted for GenEds), I signed up. \
    I hope to learn about the different approaches to ethical dilemmas, \
    and most of all I hope to gain experience navigating complex \
    ethical problems.\

    The largest takeaway so far has been hearing the unique opinions of others. \
    The default reaction when I hear about some scenario is to form an opinion and \
    then try to gauge who is for or against my ideas and what support they have. Firstly, \
    this is problematic because it is overly self-centered in judging people as being for \
    or against me and then trying to prove them right or wrong, respectively. Secondly, \
    this mindset doesn’t work because there are more than two takes on any given issue, \
    and this is why hearing the reactions of others has been so helpful. For example, I \
    studied an article on the use of AI, with human guidance, to mitigate the spread of \
    “fake news” on social media. I analyzed it from the perspective of free speech and \
    the ethics of censorship, but a classmate looked at it from the viewpoint of the \
    ethics of developing AI in social media, which I had not thought about. In this way, \
    there are not two groups, with me and against me, but rather a nearly infinite number \
     of viewpoints that are different but not necessarily competing. It is important to \
     take these views into account when designing something, or else it may harm instead \
      of help. \
      \
      As an update, I recently realized how important this class and the topics covered are to engineering, as well as the complexities and nuances involved. A short while ago, I was working with a student organization on a large engineering project. This project requires that many aspects of the product are up to code, and requires that we submit a full report of our product showing that it is acceptable. We were nearing the submission deadline for this document when we realized we did not have enough resources to manufacture everything to the thicknesses required to pass. It was quickly pointed out that the thickness of this particular part would be nearly impossible to measure, and we could easily fudge the numbers to make it work. The concern is that if this part were to fail there is a large chance of harm to the operator. The project’s chief engineer was rather indignant that he had been asked to lie on the report, but after being convinced of our lack of material and time agreed to make the numbers work if we took advantage of gray area in the rules about how we measure thickness of the component. I was a spectator to these events, and I am not sure exactly what the report document says but since I was working on building the part I know that the wall thickness is ¼ thinner than planned. Now, the argument for it is that the initial thickness estimates were over cautious and that the new ones more accurately reflect the design, but I cannot help but notice the conflict of interest of those who changed the measurements. When this happened, I was at first shocked that people I consider some of the best engineering students on campus would consider lying to meet spec, but then I remembered the cases in this class and I recognized it as a classic conflict-of-interest case. After experiencing something like this in real life, I can relate much more with the engineers in the cases with how hard it is to decide what to do, especially when people above you are pushing the unethical behavior. At the time, I did what I could to segust alternatives and to insist on building the product to spec, but in the end I was somewhat cut out of the loop. Reading about these cases, it is easy to judge what the engineers should have done, but when faced with a real issue like this one it becomes far more difficult. Based on what I learned from this course, although I am inexperienced in engineering and a new member to the organization, I am morally obligated to investigate the soundness of the product further, and I plan on taking a copy of the group’s reports to professional engineers for their opinion on the soundness of the design, as I lack the experience to give it myself. Also based on what I learned in this course, at the time I took actions to suggest alternatives and to argue for things being done correctly. I think the next step is to confirm that there is a substantial risk of harm, because at this point the next steps would be akin to whistleblowing, since we are past the point of changing the construction, which would cost the organization tens of thousands of dollars in development, at least a year setback, and likely my membership. This is the type of situation that my engineering classes did not and will not prepare me for, which demonstrates the real usefulness of the course in preparing engineers for the workforce. \

filter = `[{
    "title": "Filter Bubble",
    "content": " \
    Since I do not use social media on any regular basis, my primary filter bubbles would \
    be the newsfeed on my phone from Google and the common-minded group of people I generally \
    associate with. I would consider the news feed a filter bubble of sorts because Google \
    customizes the news to meet my interests, as I ask it to do. Similarly, hanging around \
    with people of similar mindsets tends to create a circle of confirmation, which is not \
    always the best for finding the truth, since the scientific method would require attempting \
    to prove our ideas wrong, and thus supporting our ideas by an inability to disprove them. \
    In order to “break out” of my filter buble per say, I spent some time reading articles that \
    are less aligned with what I support, such as articles that show Elon Musk in a less than \
    perfect light and blogs that support Intel over AMD. In general, I can’t say my views were \
    changed, since I already knew the argument for Intel, and my inability to find new information \
    that would sway me toward Intel only confirmed my current belief that AMD is good price to \
    performance. Again, in the case of anti-Elon articles, I could not find compelling enough \
    evidence to reverse my opinion. Although, one example of something that I did change my \
    mind on was how I ride my bike on campus. Like many of my friends, I ride my bike to get \
    around campus, and also like many of my friends, I was of the opinion that the signs put \
    up by DOTS telling bikers to ride on the sidewalk and stop at stop signs were silly at \
    best. Since everyone I usually talked to agreed, I had no motivation to do anything \
    different. But, I decided to read a few forum threads by drivers who were complaining \
    about bikers to learn about the other side of the argument, and I realized that the \
    argument for bikers following standard road rules is sound. This led me to check \
    Maryland transportation law, and I found that bikes are in fact required to follow all \
    road signs and are prohibited from riding on sidewalks unless local laws specifically \
    allow it (and Prince George’s County doesn’t). This is an example of breaking out of \
    my bubble causing me to realize that my argument was not as sound as I thought it was, \
    which led to me changing the way I ride my bike to class.\

    "title": "Listening Challenge",
    "content": " \
    I decided to listen to my younger brother for my listening challenge, who is a high school \
    freshman this year. As a summary, I think I did ok with listening, although it was difficult \
    to not express my opinion at times. After we talked about it in this class, I have been trying \
    to focus more on intentionally listening to people, as I have a reputation for talking over \
    others to give my take. The problem with this is a one-way stream of communication where I \
    bombard them with information about me without listening to what they have to say, either in \
    response to what I am saying or in general. In addition, listening to people is a way to show that \
    you care about them and think that what they have to say is worth your time to hear. In this case, I \
    realized that another limitation to talking even a reasonable amount is that it allows one person to \
    steer the conversation, consciously or subconsciously, in a way they want or expect. Much like Prof. \
    Mogul and Prof. Tomblin’s amazing demonstration of how not to do interviews, if the interviewer asks all \
    the questions the results will be skewed toward what the interviewer wants to hear. On the contrary, if \
    the interviewer puts more effort into listening to the participant, they may realize that the problem is \
    of a different nature than what they had initially thought, or that what they perceived to be a public \
    problem is less widespread than assumed. In my case, I started out by asking somewhat general questions, \
    and got answers along the lines of what I was expecting. In retrospect, these questions were analogous to \
    asking “don’t you hate it when ____?”, which greatly limits the response since the answer is in the \
    question. When I ran out of questions to ask and was forced to simply listen, I learned that some \
    things I thought my brother had been enjoying or at least been content with he saw as terrible, to \
    put it mildly. This is useful for me because it helps me better understand how his life has been \
    going since I left for college, and in this case work to rectify things that are going poorly. I \
    also noticed from listening to him that since leaving for college I have been getting the censored \
    version of events, as he told me a much less pleasant story of what has been going on than what my \
    parents had told me through phone calls. Since I had false assumptions, it was especially important \
    that I listen in order to hear the truth rather than what I want to hear. \
