    I am a freshman Aerospace Engineering student who is passionate about \
    engineering for a better society. I like engineering because I enjoy \
    creating things, but I am driven to pursue it by the idea of \
    engineering solutions that will enhance the capabilities of \
    humanity. Going into college, I was not naivete about the existence \
    of moral conflict in the profession of engineering, which was largely \
    due to the number of long conversations and debates I have had with \
    various people working in engineering or with engineers. Even before \
    signing up for classes, I had the idea that there could be a lack \
    of ethics education in the engineering discipline, so when I saw \
    this course offered (and that it counted for GenEds), I signed up. \
    I hope to learn about the different approaches to ethical dilemmas, \
    and most of all I hope to gain experience navigating complex \
    ethical problems.\

    The largest takeaway so far has been hearing the unique opinions of others. \
    The default reaction when I hear about some scenario is to form an opinion and \
    then try to gauge who is for or against my ideas and what support they have. Firstly, \
    this is problematic because it is overly self-centered in judging people as being for \
    or against me and then trying to prove them right or wrong, respectively. Secondly, \
    this mindset doesn’t work because there are more than two takes on any given issue, \
    and this is why hearing the reactions of others has been so helpful. For example, I \
    studied an article on the use of AI, with human guidance, to mitigate the spread of \
    “fake news” on social media. I analyzed it from the perspective of free speech and \
    the ethics of censorship, but a classmate looked at it from the viewpoint of the \
    ethics of developing AI in social media, which I had not thought about. In this way, \
    there are not two groups, with me and against me, but rather a nearly infinite number \
     of viewpoints that are different but not necessarily competing. It is important to \
     take these views into account when designing something, or else it may harm instead \
      of help. \
